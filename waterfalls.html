          <h5>Shankara Falls</h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            Located deep in the woods, the Shankar falls is situated on the way
            to Sringeri from Chikmagalur. The falls are inaccessible by road and
            hence, to reach the place, you will have to walk for about half a
            mile from the road. The elevation of the falls is quite low at just
            15 feet and there are further layers, where the water softly hits
            the rocks. The place is good for a picnic spot and you can spend
            about two to three hours here.

          <h5>Alekan Falls</h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            Gushing from 90 feet above the ground, the Alekan falls is located
            in between Charmadi and Kottegehara in Chikmagalur district.
            Surrounded by thick vegetation, it is a popular stop for commuters
            passing through the place to embrace ts beauty. A narrow mud path
            connects the falls to the road and it is advised to stay clear of
            deep waters due to heavy currents, which can be deceiving at times.
            The best time to visit the place is during the monsoon.

          <h5>Yelaneeru Falls</h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            Tucked inside a valley, the Yelaneeru falls can be reached by taking
            a detour from the Kalasa-Kudremukh road. The name Yelaneeru
            translates to ‘tender coconut’ and there is a village in the
            vicinity of the waterfalls by the same name. The Yelaneeru falls
            makes it to the itinerary of the Kudremukh trek and the water
            flowing here is often described to be ‘white as milk’ by the
            trekkers.

          <h5>Jerry Falls</h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            Jerry Falls is considered one of Chikmagalur’s best-kept secrets and
            are an ideal place to go and get drenched in the beauty of nature.
            You can drive to the waterfalls for the most part but the last leg,
            which is about two kilometres, requires trekking. Jeeps were allowed
            at this place at one point of time but have been stopped for some
            time now.
