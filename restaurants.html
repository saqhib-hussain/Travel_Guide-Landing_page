          <br />
          <p>
            Anyone and everyone who is on a road trip to Chikmagalur or passing
            through Chikmaglur must stop at Siri Cafe for a coffee break. A fine
            establishment located right next to Siri Nature Roost that serves
            hot beverages along with some small eats. The big sculpture of a
            beautiful lady inside the property has become very attractive among
            the tourists to take some pictures. A small man-made pond in front
            of the statue with ducks adds a nice touch to the natural and
            eco-friendly theme of the cafe.
